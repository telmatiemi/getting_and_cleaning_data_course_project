subject:
Represents the 30 volunteers in this experiment. They are identified by numbers in from 1 to 30.

The other 79 measurements names were formatted following the standard below:

(1) + (2) + (3) + "." + (4) + "..." + (5)

1 - Prefix that denotes either time or frequency domain signals. 
Domain: t - for time, 
        f - for frequency
        
2 - Acceleration signal. 
Domain: BodyAcc - Body accelation
        GravityAcc - Gravity acceleration
        
3 - If the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals:
Domain: Jerk - Jerk

4 - The set of variables that were estimated from these signals:
Domain: mean - Mean value
        std - Standard deviation
        
5 - Denotes 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions:
Domain: X
        Y
        Z
